# Description


Your program is to first request the number of patient's dietary requirements that will be entered in the interaction with the program, and must then loop this number of times to collect the amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat required for each patient. Once this data has been entered for each patient, your program must output the average amount of protein, carbohydrates, fat, and kilojoules required for all patients.

The average kilojoules can be calculated as kilojoules = 4.18 * (4*protein + 4*carbohydrates + 9.30*fat), where protein is the average amount of protein required (in grams), carbohydrates is the average amount of carbohydrates required (in grams), and fat is the average amount of fat required (in grams).
